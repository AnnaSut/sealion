# SEA-LION - Large Language Model for Southeast Asia

SEA-LION is an open source language model developed by AI Singapore to better understand the diverse contexts, languages, and cultures of Southeast Asia. 

## Key Features

- 3 to 7 billion parameters
- Trained on over 1 trillion tokens of text data from 11 languages spoken across Southeast Asia
- Specialized vocabulary and tokenization for optimal performance on SEA languages
- Excels on regional tasks and datasets
- Open source under the MIT License for community contribution and adoption

## Getting Started

The SEA-LION model files are available in the `models` directory. See the examples in the `examples` folder for how to load and use the model for inference.

To use SEA-LION:

```python
import sea_lion

model = sea_lion.load_model("sea_lion_3B")

output = model.generate(prompt="Singapore is a", max_length=30)
```

## Model Details

SEA-LION is based on the MPT architecture with 32 layers and comes in two sizes:

- **sea-lion-3B**: 3 billion parameters 
- **sea-lion-7B**: 7 billion parameters (coming soon)

It was trained on a diverse dataset of over 1 trillion tokens spanning 11 SEA languages:

- English
- Chinese  
- Indonesian
- Malay
- Thai
- Vietnamese
- Filipino
- Tamil
- Burmese
- Khmer
- Lao

The model uses a vocabulary of 256,000 tokens and a context length of 2048 tokens. It employs a custom SEA byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer to handle the unique linguistic properties of SEA languages.

## Performance

SEA-LION does as well or outperforms on regional tasks and datasets:

SEA-LION does average when it comes to general LLM tasks (as measured by Hugging Face''s LLM Leaderboard


See the [model card](MODEL_CARD.md) for full details on the datasets, metrics, and results.
